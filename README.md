# gpt4all-ios

you need to put the `gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin` under gpt4ll folder in this repo, basically look at the `.gitignore` and you will figure it out where to put the model.

i think you can get the model from here somewhere: https://gpt4all.io/index.html
and here is their repo: https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all
